                <h3>The Github Initiative</h3>
                <p>GitHub over the past 2 years has been an enriching experience – a frustrating yet very enriching all the while teaching me about open-source platforms that have devoured the internet (for the better). Every time I have worked with GitHub, I learn more about how I know nothing about GitHub. I know that If one day if I want to maintain a high-level job in this field, I will have to learn it in depth and not only just the skeleton that I know now. I want to reveal the world of open-source coding to my tiny little scope of the world of technology that I live in. Publishing to pages has not been that bad as I managed to get a hang of GitHub desktop last year.</p>

                <h3>My WWW</h3>
                <p>My experience with the internet is a love-hate relationship, now days it is a more hate than love. The internet when I first came upon it opened my eyes to a world of never-ending information, people, innovation, creativity and just pure wonder and amazement. I could not get enough of it, BUT now in 2024 I wish someone would just send us back to the dark ages and reset the toxic cesspool that we have no. It is the most vile, manipulative place that has ever existed, the absolute worst people can be found.</p>

                <h3>The WWW</h3>
                <p>In terms of looking at the internet as the WWW it has without a doubt revolutionized modern society by fostering that global connectivity and cultural exchange. Through platforms like social media, instant gratification was unlocked, boundaries were stripped overnight. The immortalized basis of information and access to that at anytime has had an impact on entertainment, commerce, activities, and politics and just the public. However, the problem with the internet growing so fast there is what is known as a digital divide and being a digital citizen has become more influential than just being a base class citizen.</p>

                <h3>Goals for a Course in Interactive Media</h3>
                I want to become proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe they are the fundamentals for base-level web design, and how to further develop them will come out of my own technical prowess. I fully believe that I can create a 100% responsive page which not only adheres to the web design principles laid out for us but also understands how the user experience goes hand in hand with the user interface. I want to fully explore a framework which I can rely on but also build on in the future.
