                <p> Look there’s a lot of bad to say about the FNB website but we'll save that for the other column, let’s talk about the good. One you immediately know its FNB’s website due to the colour scheme and branding that hits your eyes. Its good for them as you cannot really match it as a scammer, which it does a really excellent job at. There is another commandment I can give them is the website is very secure, from when you get there you feel like your sensitive information is protected and you can’t really lose it unless you do it yourself.

                <p>Now let’s talk about what I hate. For one I HATE HATE HATE how slow and Janky the website is , I did a bit of research into why this billionaire company has such a slow website. I came across the fact that they do it on purpose to stop bots from cracking their password protection systems so they slow it down so they can detect it. Which I get but as a casual human it’s very frustrating, also if I have a question, it directs me to a person rather than having a bot for quick questions which I think would be a good initiative to introduce.</p>

                <p>Fly Safair website is one of the cleanest I have ever seen , its very clear and direct what they want from you , how they want you to do it and they provide you with the tools you need. Its very simple for such a process that is hated by so many. I can’t even imagine how it looked back in 2012 when every website was a link to a 3rd party website where you had to do bookings all online and websites would take 2 hours to load and then all for you to do it in person anyway. They have done a very good job here.</p>

                    An exception being it could use some optimization on mobile but other than that everything seems great.
