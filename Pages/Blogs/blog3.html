        <h2>Blog Week 3: Understanding User Alignment</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>User Experience</h3>
            <p> When someone enters my website i want them to be in awe , not of me as a person but of just how simplistic yet exhilarating it is to scroll on my website. 
                The journey I want to take them on is a serene yet enriching one where they can see the boundaries I am trying to push In my works and how I want them to exprience 
                it with me. They must be able to understand me as a artist , human and academic , but not take for granted what I have to say for myself as I for one am 100% biased towards myself.</p>

            <h3>Mapping Content, Experience, and Interface Elements</h3>
            <p> Outlining my website was one of the hardest things for me to do as it took alot of effort to put what was in my mind into the real world/computer. Its almost too ambitious but not out of reach

            <h3>Fonts & Color Choice</h3>
            <p> Something I fully forgot to pay attention to is the UI and how it communicates with the user , does the font bring out my personality while also being readable? Does the color choice for each page match its intended design
                . Well I can't awnser that for myself but i fully hope it does as It is what i set out to do. Its something i didnt put alot of thought behind yet but I will definilty update you when I do.
