            <h3>Mapping Content, Experience, and Interface Elements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Content Mapping: Identify the types of content your site will have, such as text, images, videos, forms, etc. Determine how this content will be organized and presented to users.</li>
                <li>Experience Mapping: Create a user journey map that outlines the steps users will take when interacting with your site. This includes their entry points, navigation paths, interactions, and exit points.</li>
                <li>Interface Elements: Design the interface elements such as menus, buttons, forms, and interactive components based on user needs and usability principles. Ensure consistency in design elements across the site for a cohesive user experience.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Relating to Site Structure and URL Scheme</h3>
            <p>Relating this exercise to my site's structure and URL scheme involves ensuring that the content, experience, and interface elements are logically organized and accessible through clear navigation pathways. Semantic markup plays a crucial role in this process by using HTML elements to provide meaning and structure to the content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand and interpret the information correctly.</p>
