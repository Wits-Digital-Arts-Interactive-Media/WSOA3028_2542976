        <h2>Week 6: Ethical Dilemmas in Software Engineering</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I chose to explore Bryan Cantrills’ discussion about Andreessen’s Corollary, it all clicked to me, over the years we have been made to be more complacent when it comes to the fact that ethical dilemmas are all going down the easier rather than the correct route (the easier route 9/10 being the wrong way of doing things). I wish society can recognize why this is bad and why we must learn to recognize when this is happening. It's important to learn from our mistakes and create awareness and understanding of the ethical nature of design and look at it from multiple perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                You see, throughout the years we have grown to understand the boundaries we need to set on the internet, but we look back and realize the evolution we have taken has been to a more ethical standpoint, but we don’t enforce it as strongly as we should. Cantrill even stated himself that many developers today would not make it past the first few. Isn’t this worrying, the despairing nature of software engineers and their ability to remain ethical has declined tremendously over the years.

            <h3>Ethical Standpoint</h3>
            <p>
                The following is taken straight from the ethics.acm.org website:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.</li>
                <li>2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.</li>
                <li>3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.</li>
                <li>4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.</li>
                <li>5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.</li>
                <li>6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.</li>
                <li>7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.</li>
                <li>8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Does ANYONE Care?</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to touch on some additional research that I feel relates very well to this. TikTok is going through a lawsuit with the American Legal system as they believe that TikTok is stealing and selling American data (there’s a lot more to it but I just want to touch on it here). I feel like this is a prime modern example of the ethical dilemma of software engineers because we cannot know for sure if TikTok is doing it, but one thing we can know is that companies have done it before and companies will do it in the future. My biggest concern is that someone coded that, someone knew that was happening and did nothing about it. Like where do you as a developer understand that you are crossing a line and putting not only people who don’t know any better at risk but taking advantage of simplistic people.
