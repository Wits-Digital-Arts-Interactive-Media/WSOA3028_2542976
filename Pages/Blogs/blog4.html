                <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I found working on this website I had a lot of trouble when it came to the CSS of some of the elements, as I found myself looking at a lot of tutorials on W3Schools and YouTube in tandem with forums. I'm not too sure if this is normal or okay but it didn't feel alright, and I felt like I was missing something. I don't know if I am doing the course wrong but I hope not. I really want to (and need to) kill it in this course; the passion I have for it is unmatched, and I wish I could just prove to everyone that I know what I'm doing and I really am capable and creative amongst my peers. I should stand out.</p>
