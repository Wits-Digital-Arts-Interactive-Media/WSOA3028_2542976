        <h3> My Thoughts </h3>
    <p> I found working on this website I had a lot of trouble when it came to the css of some of the elements , as I found myself looking at lot of tutorials on W3Scools and Youtube in tandem with forums.
        I'm not to sure if this is normal or okay but it didn't feel alright and I felt like I was missing something , I don;t know if I am doing the course wrong but I hope not. I really want to (and need to) kill it in this course the passion I have for it is unmatached and I wish 
        I could just prove to everyone that I know what i'm doing and I really am cabable and creative amoungst my peers I should stand out.
