                                <h3>The Github Initiative</h3>
                                <p>GitHub over the past 2 years has been an enriching experience – a frustrating yet very enriching all the while teaching me about open-source platforms that have devoured the internet (for the better). Every time I have worked with GitHub, I learn more about how I know nothing about GitHub. I know that If one day if I want to maintain a high-level job in this field, I will have to learn it in depth and not only just the skeleton that I know now. I want to reveal the world of open-source coding to my tiny little scope of the world of technology that I live in. Publishing to pages has not been that bad as I managed to get a hang of GitHub desktop last year.</p>

                                <p>My experience with the internet is a love-hate relationship, now days it is a more hate than love. The internet when I first came upon it opened my eyes to a world of never-ending information, people, innovation, creativity and just pure wonder and amazement. I could not get enough of it, BUT now in 2024 I wish someone would just send us back to the dark ages and reset the toxic cesspool that we have no. It is the most vile, manipulative place that has ever existed, the absolute worst people can be found.</p>

                                <p>In terms of looking at the internet as the WWW it has without a doubt revolutionized modern society by fostering that global connectivity and cultural exchange. Through platforms like social media, instant gratification was unlocked, boundaries were stripped overnight. The immortalized basis of information and access to that at anytime has had an impact on entertainment, commerce, activities, and politics and just the public. However, the problem with the internet growing so fast there is what is known as a digital divide and being a digital citizen has become more influential than just being a base class citizen.</p>

                                <h3>Goals for a Course in Interactive Media</h3>
                                I want to become proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe they are the fundamentals for base-level web design, and how to further develop them will come out of my own technical prowess. I fully believe that I can create a 100% responsive page which not only adheres to the web design principles laid out for us but also understands how the user experience goes hand in hand with the user interface. I want to fully explore a framework which I can rely on but also build on in the future.

                                    <li>Root Folder</li>
                                    <li>index.html (or main entry point)</li>
                                    <li>css/ (folder for cascading style sheets)</li>
                                    <li>js/ (folder for JavaScript files)</li>
                                    <li>images/ (folder for images used on the website)</li>
                                    <li>pages/ (folder for individual HTML pages if the site is multi-page)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p> I've done my folder structure in this way to mainly keep to the conventional layout of a websites folder structure. In our first class Hanli said that when working with other dev's in this space
                                    , you have to recognise that everyone will have different ideas of how they want the website to look , but one thing everyone should agree on is the structure of the project. This is so it is almost a universal
                                    langague across everything that is happening in the project
                                </p>

                                <p> The URL scheme for my website consists of my github page which is the hub to all things within my website. It is showing off the works of my life 
                                    and my works as a student. The course of interactive media has given me a platform to share my passions and opinions.
                    
                                    It is my way of sharing my perspectives and leading you on a path through my mind and how I think as see things. Using the platform of the classes GIT I am collabing with multiple devs to create a portfolio of multiple different personalaities.

                                    The journey I want to take them on is a serene yet enriching one where they can see the boundaries I am trying to push In my works and how I want them to exprience 
                                    it with me. They must be able to understand me as a artist , human and academic , but not take for granted what I have to say for myself as I for one am 100% biased towards myself.</p>

                                <p> Something I fully forgot to pay attention to is the UI and how it communicates with the user , does the font bring out my personality while also being readable? Does the color choice for each page match its intended design
                                    . Well I can't awnser that for myself but i fully hope it does as It is what i set out to do. Its something i didnt put alot of thought behind yet but I will definilty update you when I do.

I'm not too sure if this is normal or okay but it didn't feel alright, and I felt like I was missing something. I don't know if I am doing the course wrong but I hope not. I really want to (and need to) kill it in this course; the passion I have for it is unmatched, and I wish I could just prove to everyone that I know what I'm doing and I really am capable and creative amongst my peers. I should stand out.</p>

One you immediately know its FNB’s website due to the colour scheme and branding that hits your eyes. Its good for them as you cannot really match it as a scammer, which it does a really excellent job at. There is another commandment I can give them is the website is very secure, from when you get there you feel like your sensitive information is protected and you can’t really lose it unless you do it yourself.</p>

I came across the fact that they do it on purpose to stop bots from cracking their password protection systems so they slow it down so they can detect it. Which I get but as a casual human it’s very frustrating, also if I have a question, it directs me to a person rather than having a bot for quick questions which I think would be a good initiative to introduce.</p>

                                    <p>Fly Safair website is one of the cleanest I have ever seen , its very clear and direct what they want from you , how they want you to do it and they provide you with the tools you need. Its very simple for such a process that is hated by so many. I can’t even imagine how it looked back in 2012 when every website was a link to a 3rd party website where you had to do bookings all online and websites would take 2 hours to load and then all for you to do it in person anyway. They have done a very good job here.</p>

                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>
                                I chose to explore Bryan Cantrills’ discussion about Andreessen’s Corollary, it all clicked to me, over the years we have been made to be more complacent when it comes to the fact that ethical dilemmas are all going down the easier rather than the correct route (the easier route 9/10 being the wrong way of doing things). I wish society can recognize why this is bad and why we must learn to recognize when this is happening. It's important to learn from our mistakes and create awareness and understanding of the ethical nature of design and look at it from multiple perspectives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You see, throughout the years we have grown to understand the boundaries we need to set on the internet, but we look back and realize the evolution we have taken has been to a more ethical standpoint, but we don’t enforce it as strongly as we should. Cantrill even stated himself that many developers today would not make it past the first few. Isn’t this worrying, the despairing nature of software engineers and their ability to remain ethical has declined tremendously over the years.

                            <p>
                                I would like to touch on some additional research that I feel relates very well to this. TikTok is going through a lawsuit with the American Legal system as they believe that TikTok is stealing and selling American data (there’s a lot more to it but I just want to touch on it here). I feel like this is a prime modern example of the ethical dilemma of software engineers because we cannot know for sure if TikTok is doing it, but one thing we can know is that companies have done it before and companies will do it in the future. My biggest concern is that someone coded that, someone knew that was happening and did nothing about it. Like where do you as a developer understand that you are crossing a line and putting not only people who don’t know any better at risk but taking advantage of simplistic people.

It highlights that digital inclusion is crucial for social justice, equating the issue with civil rights in the 21st century.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Key Points:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Digital Divide and Inequality:</strong> The article underscores that despite widespread marketing of digital devices, access remains unequal globally due to high costs, lack of infrastructure, and inadequate digital literacy.</li>
                                <li><strong>Impact of COVID-19:</strong> The pandemic has exacerbated digital divides, as digital technology became vital for remote work, education, and social interaction. Those without access faced increased marginalization.</li>
                                <li><strong>Intersectional Challenges:</strong> Digital divides are layered, intersecting with socio-economic status, race, gender, age, location, and more. This intersectionality means that policy solutions must be multifaceted and inclusive.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cultural Preservation:</strong> Rural and isolated communities face a “rural penalty” that limits their participation in the digital world, risking the loss of cultural heritage. Access to broadband can mitigate this penalty, promoting cultural exchange and economic opportunities.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Critical Analysis:</h3>
                            <p>
                                The article effectively frames digital inclusion as a civil rights issue, emphasizing the necessity for equitable access to technology. However, it could benefit from more concrete examples of successful initiatives and policies that have effectively bridged the digital divide. Additionally, while it highlights the importance of intersectional approaches, it would be valuable to delve deeper into specific strategies that address these layered challenges.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Further Research:</h3>

                                <h3>Ballatore et al. - 2017: Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engines</h3>
                                <p>Ballatore et al. (2017) examine how search engine algorithms reflect and reinforce local hegemonies. The study reveals the inherent biases in search engine algorithms, which often prioritize content from dominant cultures and languages. This can marginalize local knowledge and perspectives, contributing to a homogenized digital landscape.</p>
                                <p>The research highlights the significant power major search engines hold in shaping public discourse and knowledge dissemination. It calls for more transparent and inclusive digital practices to mitigate algorithmic biases and promote a more equitable information landscape.</p>
