            <h2>Font & Color Choices</h2>
            <p>I'm really into the idea of crafting a super modern website. I'm all about that flow where everything just clicks together – from the vibrant colors playing off each other to the fonts that perfectly complement the vibe. Right now, I'm in that sweet spot of exploration, seeing what works and what doesn't. But I gotta say, I'm liking where I'm at with it all.</p>

            <h2>Style</h2>
            <p>Minimalism? Oh yeah, that's totally my jam. I'm all about keeping things clean and sleek, stripping away the excess to focus on what really matters. But here's the thing – I don't want to sacrifice excitement for simplicity. Finding that sweet spot where minimalism meets creativity is my goal. And you know what? I'm all for exploring different avenues, not just sticking to one medium. Mixing things up keeps it fresh and adds layers to my academic work.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>I feel like a good approach to this all is to create color palettes to keep track of it all. So in <a href="../Blogs/blog3.html">Blog Post Week 3</a>, you can check it out! I show a lot more of my process here.</p>

            <h2> Goal Alignment </h2>
            <p>In my study, I want to figure out how to make websites that do exactly what their owners want them to do. You know when you visit a website and it's easy to find what you need and it looks great? That's what I'm aiming for. By looking at how websites are built and how people use them, I want to help design and make websites that make everyone happy – the owners and the visitors.</p>

            <h2>Information Structure</h2>
            <p>For my portfolio website, I wanted a simple and clean structure that would allow visitors to easily navigate and find the content they are looking for. The main sections are the Index/Home page, Portfolio showcasing my projects, an About Me page detailing my background and skills, a section for Essays I've written, Blogposts with regular updates, a Design section, and a Playground area for experimental content. This covers all the key information a visitor might want in an organized manner.</p>

            <h2> NYT Redesign </h2>
            <p> One of my favorite things about websites is how they can quite literally change overnight.  <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/redesign/?sub=100"> The New York Times Redesign </a> is one of my favorite not becuase they did innovative things , no they just managed to create a platform that has such a impeccable flow and character. They changed 3 i want to note are the follwing; The horizontal scroll at the top of the page provides quick access to related stories, encouraging further exploration. Enlarging photos and illustrations within the story keeps users immersed while maintaining visual appeal. Additionally, the sections list simplifies navigation, allowing users to seamlessly switch between their preferred content categories.  </p>

            <h2>User Flow</h2>
            <p>The homepage welcomes visitors with a bold intro and provides an overview of what they can expect on the site. From there, they can easily access the different sections through the navigation menu. On the Portfolio page, they can browse through my various projects with visuals and descriptions. The About Me page gives insights into my story, hobbies, technical skills, and tools I work with. The Essays section allows downloading or reading my longform writings. And the Blogposts showcase my latest thoughts and musings. The user can freely explore based on their interests.</p>

    <h2>Notes On Visual Aesthetic</h2>
    <p>My goal was a minimal yet bold aesthetic with lots of white space. I wanted the content to be the focus, enhanced by pops of color, geometric shapes, and some textured elements. Overall, a modern and clean look.</p>

        <li>High contrast color palette with shades of black, white, red</li>
        <li>Sans-serif typography with different weights</li>

            <h2>Code Break Down</h2>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>Key Points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metadata: The *head* section contains all my metadata, including my viewport settings, information about the author, and a character set.</li>
                <li>Styling: I have in place the framework for my CSS filing.</li>
                <li>Script: I have my script.js where it imports the Javascript module and initializes it with the function initialise (then the page it is on).</li>
                <li>Structure: The page has a nav menu, a dynamically generated menu container, the main content section, and then my footer.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>Key Points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Root Path: The root constant stores the base path of the website, which is used as a prefix for all page URLs.</li>
                <li>Pages Array: The pages array contains objects representing different pages with their names and relative URLs.</li>
                <li>Navigation Initialization Function: The initialise function dynamically generates a navigation menu based on the provided page data.</li>

            <h2>FULL CODE BREAKDOWN Pt.1- </h2>
            <p> The structure and layout of my website is built primarily using HTML and CSS. The header contains a navigation menu implemented as an unordered list (ul) with list items (li) representing each menu item. The body section utilizes semantic HTML elements like (header), (nav), (main), and (footer) to organize the content hierarchy. To achieve the grid-like layout for displaying projects and blog posts,  I employed CSS Grid or Flexbox, which provide powerful layout capabilities. Additionally, CSS animations and transitions were used to create the subtle particle effect on the landing page.

        <section class="card">
            <h2>FULL CODE BREAKDOWN Pt.2 - </h2>
            <p> JavaScript played a crucial role in adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to my website. For instance, the navigation menu may use JavaScript to toggle between the hamburger and expanded states on smaller screens, ensuring a responsive experience. The project sections  leverage JavaScript to create interactive image galleries or carousels, enhancing the visual appeal. Additionally, JavaScript Libraries like jQuery were utilized to streamline development and provide reusable components.</p>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>FULL CODE BREAKDOWN Pt.3 - </h2>
            <p> To ensure an optimal user experience across devices, I have implemented responsive design techniques using CSS media & queries. These queries allowed me to apply different styles based on screen size, accommodating various viewports. Furthermore, I made use of CSS positive practices to modularize my stylesheets, enabling easier maintenance and code organization. Inline SVG icons or icon fonts were used for scalable, resolution-independent icons throughout the website.</p>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>FULL CODE BREAKDOWN Pt.4 - </h2>
            <p> The landing page showcases a minimalistic yet visually appealing design,  achieved through careful use of CSS. The particle effect is in there and used to create using the canvas element and JavaScript,  leveraging a library with particles.js i coded it myself though. The typography choice, with a clean sans-serif font for headings and body text, contribute to the overall aesthetic. Overall, my website's UI/UX implementation demonstrates a my thoughtful approach to design, layout, interactivity. </p>

            <h2>Issues & Future Fixes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>ALL PAGES: On all the pages there is the words "More (Drop Down Menu)". This is intentional to mark where I want my drop-down menu to be. It has not been implemented as of yet but I am leaving it there to show what I want my menu to look like and where I want it to be. -- not fixed</li>
                <li>Blog Post buttons position feels off and you cannot click the button, you have to click the URL text -- not fixed</li>
                <li>Portfolio Page has no content and needs to fix the coming soon link -- not fixed</li>
                <li>Index Page image not showing, and alt text not showing either -- fixed (10/05/2024 14:40)</li>
