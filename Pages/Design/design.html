            <p>I'm really into the idea of crafting a super modern website. I'm all about that flow where everything just clicks together – from the vibrant colors playing off each other to the fonts that perfectly complement the vibe. Right now, I'm in that sweet spot of exploration, seeing what works and what doesn't. But I gotta say, I'm liking where I'm at with it all.</p>

            <p>Minimalism? Oh yeah, that's totally my jam. I'm all about keeping things clean and sleek, stripping away the excess to focus on what really matters. But here's the thing – I don't want to sacrifice excitement for simplicity. Finding that sweet spot where minimalism meets creativity is my goal. And you know what? I'm all for exploring different avenues, not just sticking to one medium. Mixing things up keeps it fresh and adds layers to my academic work.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>I feel like a good approach to this all is to create color palettes to keep track of it all. So in <a href="../Blogs/blog3.html">Blog Post Week 3</a>, you can check it out! I show a lot more of my process here.</p>

            <h2>Code Break Down</h2>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>Key Points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metadata: The *head* section contains all my metadata, including my viewport settings, information about the author, and a character set.</li>
                <li>Styling: I have in place the framework for my CSS filing.</li>
                <li>Script: I have my script.js where it imports the Javascript module and initializes it with the function initialise (then the page it is on).</li>
                <li>Structure: The page has a nav menu, a dynamically generated menu container, the main content section, and then my footer.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>Key Points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Root Path: The root constant stores the base path of the website, which is used as a prefix for all page URLs.</li>
                <li>Pages Array: The pages array contains objects representing different pages with their names and relative URLs.</li>
                <li>Navigation Initialization Function: The initialise function dynamically generates a navigation menu based on the provided page data.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Issues & Future Fixes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>ALL PAGES: On all the pages there is the words "More (Drop Down Menu)". This is intentional to mark where I want my drop-down menu to be. It has not been implemented as of yet but I am leaving it there to show what I want my menu to look like and where I want it to be. -- not fixed</li>
                <li>Blog Post buttons position feels off and you cannot click the button, you have to click the URL text -- not fixed</li>
                <li>Portfolio Page has no content and needs to fix the coming soon link -- not fixed</li>
                <li>Index Page image not showing, and alt text not showing either -- fixed (10/05/2024 14:40)</li>
