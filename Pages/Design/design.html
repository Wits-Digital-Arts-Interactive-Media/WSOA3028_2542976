            <h2>Font & Color Choices</h2>
            <p>I'm really into the idea of crafting a super modern website. I'm all about that flow where everything just clicks together – from the vibrant colors playing off each other to the fonts that perfectly complement the vibe. Right now, I'm in that sweet spot of exploration, seeing what works and what doesn't. But I gotta say, I'm liking where I'm at with it all.</p>

            <h2>Style On Style</h2>
            <p> I see my website as a serene canvas where every element has its own space. This approach not only enhances the visual appeal but also improves the overall user experience by making navigation intuitive and content easy to consume.

                By using ample white space, I give my content the spotlight it deserves. This technique helps in emphasizing key messages, calls to action, and important information without overwhelming my visitors.
                
                For me, minimalism isn't just about aesthetics; it's about functionality and purpose. Each element on my website serves a clear purpose and contributes to the overall user experience.</p>

            <h2> Goal Alignment </h2>
            <p>In my study, I want to figure out how to make websites that do exactly what their owners want them to do. You know when you visit a website and it's easy to find what you need and it looks great? That's what I'm aiming for. By looking at how websites are built and how people use them, I want to help design and make websites that make everyone happy – the owners and the visitors.</p>

            <h2>Information Structure</h2>
            <p>For my portfolio website, I wanted a simple and clean structure that would allow visitors to easily navigate and find the content they are looking for. The main sections are the Index/Home page, Portfolio showcasing my projects, an About Me page detailing my background and skills, a section for Essays I've written, Blogposts with regular updates, a Design section, and a Playground area for experimental content. This covers all the key information a visitor might want in an organized manner.</p>

    <h2>Notes On Visual Aesthetic</h2>
    <p>My goal was a minimal yet bold aesthetic with lots of white space. I wanted the content to be the focus, enhanced by pops of color, geometric shapes, and some textured elements. Overall, a modern and clean look.</p>
    
        <li>High contrast color palette with shades of black, white, red</li>
        <li>Sans-serif typography with different weights</li>
        <li>Icons and simple illustrations as visual accents</li>

    <h2>Style Guide </h2>
    <p>Your goal and aesthetic as a single statement: Create a bold, minimal, and content-focused design aesthetic that feels modern, clean, and visually striking by embracing minimalism through a limited color palette and simple geometric shapes, utilizing strong contrasting colors and large impactful typography for boldness, prioritizing content with ample white space for readability, incorporating contemporary design trends for modernity, maintaining a tidy and uncluttered layout for cleanliness, and using high-quality imagery and sharp icons for visual impact.</p>

    <h2>Notes On Visual Aesthetic</h2>
    <p>The visual design elements selected:</p>
    <p>Additional design considerations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Color Palette: Muted tones with occasional vibrant colors to draw attention</li>
        <li>Typography: Clean sans-serif fonts for readability, with varying weights to create hierarchy</li>
        <li>Imagery: Minimal use of images to maintain focus on content, with a preference for retro images</li>
        <li>Button Design: Rounded corners with subtle shadows to create a modern and minimalistic look</li>

    <h2>Page Design</h2>
    <h3>The overall design</h3>
 
        <p> - My goal was to create a clean and minimalistic design that prioritizes content and visual appeal. I believe that simplicity is key to effective communication, and this philosophy guided every design choice I made. By using ample whitespace and a straightforward layout, I ensured that the viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the core messages and visuals.
        <p> - The overall design reflects my unique style and personal brand. It’s a blend of creativity and professionalism, which is crucial for a personal portfolio site. I wanted visitors to not only see my work but also get a sense of who I am as a creator and professional.</p>

    <h2>Additional Reaserch: </h2>
    <h3>WHITE SPACE AND BOLDNESS</h3>
    <p>Whitespace acts as a silent guide, creating breathing room between elements to enhance readability and reduce clutter. It fosters a sense of simplicity and elegance, inviting users to focus on key content without feeling overwhelmed. Boldness, on the other hand, serves as a confident statement-maker, drawing attention to important elements such as headlines, buttons, or key messages. When balanced effectively, these elements work in tandem to create a harmonious user experience, where clarity and engagement are seamlessly woven into the fabric of the design.</p>

    <h2>Additional Reaserch: </h2>
    <h3>USER FLOW & FRUSTRATION AVOIDANCE</h3>
   <p>User flow is the orchestrated journey that a visitor takes through a website, guiding them from their entry point to their desired destination. It's crucial because it directly influences how users interact with and perceive the site's content and functionality. A well-crafted user flow ensures that navigation is intuitive and seamless, reducing friction and frustration.</p>
   <p> User flow also helps in identifying potential pain points or bottlenecks in the user journey, allowing for iterative improvements that align with user expectations and business objectives. Ultimately, prioritizing user flow in web design promotes a positive experience, encourages engagement, and fosters long-term relationships between users and the website.</p>

            <h2>FULL CODE BREAKDOWN Pt.1- </h2>
            <p> The structure and layout of my website is built primarily using HTML and CSS. The header contains a navigation menu implemented as an unordered list (ul) with list items (li) representing each menu item. The body section utilizes semantic HTML elements like (header), (nav), (main), and (footer) to organize the content hierarchy. To achieve the grid-like layout for displaying projects and blog posts,  I employed CSS Grid or Flexbox, which provide powerful layout capabilities. Additionally, CSS animations and transitions were used to create the subtle particle effect on the landing page.

            <h2>FULL CODE BREAKDOWN Pt.2 - </h2>
            <p> JavaScript played a crucial role in adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to my website. For instance, the navigation menu may use JavaScript to toggle between the hamburger and expanded states on smaller screens, ensuring a responsive experience. The project sections  leverage JavaScript to create interactive image galleries or carousels, enhancing the visual appeal. Additionally, JavaScript Libraries like jQuery were utilized to streamline development and provide reusable components.</p>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>FULL CODE BREAKDOWN Pt.3 - </h2>
            <p> To ensure an optimal user experience across devices, I have implemented responsive design techniques using CSS media & queries. These queries allowed me to apply different styles based on screen size, accommodating various viewports. Furthermore, I made use of CSS positive practices to modularize my stylesheets, enabling easier maintenance and code organization. Inline SVG icons or icon fonts were used for scalable, resolution-independent icons throughout the website.</p>

            <p> The landing page showcases a minimalistic yet visually appealing design,  achieved through careful use of CSS. The particle effect is in there and used to create using the canvas element and JavaScript,  leveraging a library with particles.js i coded it myself though. The typography choice, with a clean sans-serif font for headings and body text, contribute to the overall aesthetic. Overall, my website's UI/UX implementation demonstrates a my thoughtful approach to design, layout, interactivity. </p>
